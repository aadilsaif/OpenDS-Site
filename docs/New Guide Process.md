# Process for Adding New Guides

Hi, 

Thank you for contributing to the Open Data Set Repository. There are two different ways to add the current dataset into a markdown version for it to be added into the repository. If you are starting from scratch, it is recommended to use the New Guide Template file as a template for your guide. However, if you already have a guide that is written, that can also be ported over to markdown to be added to the current repository.
